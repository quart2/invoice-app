# Invoice Generator Web App - MERN Stack

This project is a fully functional **Invoice Generator Web App** built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to generate, view, and manage invoices, providing them with the option to download invoices as PDF files. The app also supports invoice deletion and features a clean, responsive user interface built with **React** and **TailwindCSS**.

## Project Overview

This Invoice Generator Web App allows users to:
- **Create invoices**: Add customer details and invoice information.
- **View invoices**: Display all previously generated invoices in a table.
- **Download as PDF**: Generate and download invoices in PDF format with jsPDF.
- **Delete invoices**: Remove invoices from the system with a simple click.
- **Fully responsive design**: The app is mobile-friendly and looks great on all screen sizes.


## Features

- **Create and Manage Invoices**: Users can easily create and save invoices.
- **PDF Generation**: Invoices can be downloaded as PDF documents for easy sharing and record-keeping.
- **Delete Invoices**: Invoices can be deleted from the system through a confirmation modal.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using **React** and **TailwindCSS** for a clean, modern, and responsive design.
- **Backend API**: The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express** to handle CRUD operations, and **MongoDB** stores the invoice data.
- **Authentication (Optional)**: User authentication and session management can be integrated for personalized invoice management (this can be added in future iterations).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have **Node.js** and **npm** (or **pnpm**) installed. If you don’t have them installed, you can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps to Install

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pawantech12/invoice-generator.git
   cd invoice-generator
   ```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd client
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Install the backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd server
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the `server` directory and add your MongoDB connection URI:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
   PORT=3000
   ```
5. Create a `.env` file in the root of the `client` directory and add your backedn Url(default is http://localhost:3000):
   ```
   VITE_APP_BACKEND_URL=your_backend_url
   ```

6. Start the development servers:

   - For the backend (server):
     ```bash
     pnpm start
     ```

   - For the frontend (client):
     ```bash
     pnpm run dev
     ```

The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` and the backend at `http://localhost:3000`.
